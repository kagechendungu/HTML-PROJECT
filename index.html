    <h2><strong><em> ROAD NOT TAKEN</em></strong> </h2>
    <p>two roads diverge in a yellow wood<br>
    and sorry I would not travel both<br>
    and be one of the traveler long I stood<br>
    And looked down one as far I could<br>
    to where it bent in the growth<br>
    Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
    And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
    Though as for that the passing there<br>
    Had worn them really about the same,<br>
    
    And both that morning equally lay<br>
    In leaves, no step had trodden black.<br>
    Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
    Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
    I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
    
    I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
    Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
    Two roads diverged in a wood, and I<br>
    I took the one less traveled by,<br>
    And that has made all the difference<br>
